This is second version of my portfolio. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS end shadcn/ui.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment

Deploy to Firebase hosting:
```bash
npm run deploy
```


## TODO

- Include rest of my projects
- Add blog
- Write short, descriptive posts about my projects (decision making, process, design, etc.)
